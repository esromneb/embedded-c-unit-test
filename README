#### Instructions
Each test must be declared with the CU_TEST(name) macro.  The name parameter
should describe what the test covers.
  
There are four macros which can be used to test conditions in your application:
  assertTrue(a)
  assertFalse(a)
  assertEquals(a,b)
  assertNotEquals(a,b)

The assertTrue(a) and assertFalse(a) macros test the object inside the brackets
using a simple if() statement.  This means that non-zero values are considered true
and zero values are considered false.

The assertEquals(a,b) and assertNotEquals(a,b) macros use the == and != operators
to test for equality.

The last function in this file, "void run_test( void )", is used to run each
test case.  This file must be manually updated so that every test defined with CU_TEST()
has a a matching CU_RUN_TEST().  If you add a new unit test, do not forget to update
this file.

You can disable tests for the demo by editing the global.h file.
